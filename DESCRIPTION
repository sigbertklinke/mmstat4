Description: The package provides local access to teaching materials on the internet stored as ZIP files (e.g. from a GitHub repository). 
    The default repository is the GitHub repository 'sigbertklinke/mmstat4.data', which contains R programs, Shiny apps, data 
    and PDF documents for several statistics courses. In addition, some functions are implemented that are needed for the Shiny apps.
