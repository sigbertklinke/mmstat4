  c(person(given = "Sigbert",
           family = "Klinke",
           role = c("aut", "cre"),

Description: Teaching materials, e.g. R programs, Shiny apps, data and PDF documents stored 
    on the internet in a ZIP file (e.g. as a GitHub repository) can be downloaded and displayed
    and executed locally. The contents of the ZIP file are stored locally temporarily or permanently. 
    The standard repository used is the GitHub repository 'sigbertklinke/mmstat4.data', which contains 
    R programs, Shiny apps, data and PDF documents for various statistics courses. In addition, 
    some functions are implemented that are needed for the Shiny apps.
