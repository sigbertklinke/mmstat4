Description: Teaching materials, e.g. R programmes, Shiny apps, data and PDF documents, 
    which are stored on the internet in a ZIP file (e.g. as a GitHub repository) can be downloaded 
    and displayed and executed locally. The content of the ZIP file is stored locally temporarily 
    (or permanently). 
    The GitHub repository "sigbertklinke/mmstat4.data" is used as the default repository. 
    In addition, some auxiliary functions are implemented.
