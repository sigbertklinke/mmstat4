# mmstat4

MM*Stat was originally published as a CD in 1998 by Prof. Dr. W. Härdle and Prof. Dr. B. Rönz from the Chair of Statistics at the Faculty of Economics at Humboldt University in Berlin in cooperation with the company MHSG.

The R package now collects data and R programmes that we use in various courses on statistics at the Chair of Statistics at the Faculty of Economics at the Humboldt University of Berlin.

# Installation  

Since the package is not available at CRAN it has to be installed from GitHub:

```R
library("devtools")
install_github(build_vignettes = TRUE)
```
